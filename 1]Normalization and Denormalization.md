### **Normalization and Denormalization in SQL (Simple Explanation)**

In SQL, **normalization** and **denormalization** are two key techniques used to organize data in a database. Both aim to improve performance, but they serve different purposes.

---

### **1. Normalization**
‚úÖ **Purpose:** To reduce data redundancy (repeated data) and improve data integrity.

### **Key Idea:** Break large tables into smaller, related tables.

### **Example of Normalization**
Imagine a **"Student"** table like this:

| Student_ID | Name   | Course   | Instructor |
|-------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 101          | Alice  | Math      | Mr. Smith   |
| 102          | Bob    | Science   | Dr. John    |
| 103          | Alice  | Science   | Dr. John    |

‚û°Ô∏è Notice that **Alice** appears twice, and **Dr. John** is mentioned twice. This is redundant.

### **Normalized Version**
Break this into two tables:

**Students Table**
| Student_ID | Name  |
|-------------|--------|
| 101          | Alice  |
| 102          | Bob    |

**Courses Table**
| Student_ID | Course  | Instructor |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 101          | Math   | Mr. Smith   |
| 102          | Science| Dr. John    |
| 101          | Science| Dr. John    |

‚úÖ Now, student names and instructor details are stored once. This eliminates redundancy.

### **2. Denormalization**
‚úÖ **Purpose:** To improve query performance by combining data into fewer tables.

### **Key Idea:** Merge related tables to reduce the number of joins in queries.

### **Example of Denormalization**
Suppose you have two separate tables:

**Employee Table**  
| Emp_ID | Name   | Department_ID |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1        | John   | 101           |
| 2        | Alice  | 102           |

**Department Table**  
| Department_ID | Department_Name |
|----------------|------------------|
| 101              | HR               |
| 102              | IT               |

‚û°Ô∏è Instead of joining two tables every time, we can denormalize them into one table:

**Denormalized Table**  
| Emp_ID | Name   | Department_Name |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| 1        | John   | HR               |
| 2        | Alice  | IT               |

‚úÖ This reduces query complexity and improves speed but may increase redundancy.

### **Key Differences**
| Aspect            | Normalization                  | Denormalization               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Minimize data redundancy      | Improve read performance      |
| **Data Structure**  | Divides data into smaller tables | Combines data into fewer tables |
| **Data Integrity**  | Strong (fewer data anomalies) | Weaker (higher risk of inconsistent data) |
| **Query Speed**      | Slower due to multiple joins  | Faster as fewer joins are needed |

---

### **When to Use What?**
‚úÖ **Use Normalization** when:
- Data consistency and integrity are critical.
- Redundant data needs to be minimized.

‚úÖ **Use Denormalization** when:
- Faster query performance is required.
- The system is more read-heavy than write-heavy.
